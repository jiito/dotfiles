# `~/` dotfiles

This is a repository to keep track of the the dotfiles and configs I use. It is a replica of my home dir `~/` but does track changes in untracked files. 

I set it up following [this tutorial](https://dev.to/bowmanjd/store-home-directory-config-files-dotfiles-in-git-using-bash-zsh-or-powershell-the-bare-repo-approach-35l3?utm_source=pocket_mylist)
